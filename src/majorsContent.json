        "overview": "The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) encompasses multi-disciplinary programs at the interface between the traditional fields of natural history, environmental biology, and natural resource management. Primary foci are the management of sustainable fisheries of commercially important species; biocomplexity and ecosystem-based management; and sustainable aquaculture. In addition, human-induced effects on natural ecosystems (including habitat change and restoration, impacts of climate change, emerging diseases, the effects of invasive species, and processes affecting endangered species and declining populations) are major areas of research. In pursuit of these objectives, a variety of basic sciences are used, including ecology and evolution, population biology, behavior, physiology, microbiology, and genetics. The scope of aquatic systems ranges from watersheds, rivers and lakes, to estuarine and near-shore shelf, open ocean systems and culture facilities. Graduates of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences are uniquely qualified for careers in universities as well as other educational settings, natural resources management agencies at the local to international levels, environmental consulting, and non-profit organizations with an environmental focus."
